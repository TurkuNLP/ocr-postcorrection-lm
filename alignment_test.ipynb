The winds, that now their wings unfold, Shall hear, and from their mountain caves Unfold their harps, and join the sounds Of liquid grief, and liquid joys. V. While Fidele's voice, in silent air, Shall hover round the weeping bower, And bid the flowers, and all things there, Weep, till their tears become a shower. VI. And when the last sad note is done, And all things seem to sink in woe, The sun shall rise, and scatter light O'er Fidele's grave, and all below. VII. And Fidele's spirit, from its sleep, Shall rise, and on the flowers sit, And smile upon the weeping grief Of those who loved him, and will miss. VIII. Thus shall the living mourn the dead, And all things pay their tribute due; While Fidele's name, like music, spread O'er earth, and all the world below. Note: GUIDERUS and ARVIRAGUS are characters in the poem, possibly representing the speaker or a group of people mourning the loss of Fidele. The poem is a tribute to Fidele, who is supposed to be dead, and it describes a series of events where nature, spirits, and even the sun come together to honor his memory.\""

A SONG FROM SHAKESPEAR's CYMBELINE.  [71] A SONG  FROM  SHAKESPEAR's CYMBELINE. Sung by GUIDERUS and ARVIRAGUS over  F I D E L E, supposed to be dead.  By the Same.  I. T O fair Fidele's grassy tomb  Soft maids, and village hinds lhall bring  Each op'ning fieet, of earliert bloom, And rifle all the breathing Spring.  II.  No wailing ghost shall dare appear  To vex with shrieks this quiet grove:  But Ihepherd lads assemble here, And melting virgins own their love.  E 4 III. No  tum'l'd  bones  shall  stir  To  wail  the  departed  soul:  But  lilting  lips  shall  sing  her  praise,  And  lips  that  are  not  lips  shall  join  the  chorus.  IV.  The  lark  and  linnet  shall  affirm  Her  memory  in  the  air:  And  every  bird  that  flies  Shall  echo  her  sweet  song.  V.  The  blossom  that  her  hand  plucked  first  Shall  wear  its  garland  to  the  end:  And  every  flower  That  grows  Shall  wear  its  pride  upon  its  head.  VI.  The  stream  that  flow'd  from  off  Her  eye  Shall  be  her  tears  for ever:  And  every  drop  That  drops  Shall  be  her  tears  upon  the  earth.  VII.  The  moon  and  stars  Shall  light  her  tomb  with  beams:  And  all  the  heavens  Shall  shower  her  ashes  with  their  tears.  VIII.  The  nightingale  shall  sing  her  lullaby,  And  every  bird  That  sleeps  Shall  join  her  sighs.  IX.  The  wind  shall  whisper  her  name,  And  every  tree  Shall  answer  with  a  groan.  X.  The  earth  shall  cover  her  grave,  And  all  her  friends  Shall  lie  beneath  it.  XI.  The  world  shall  mourn  her  loss,  And  all  her  lovers  Shall  die  of  grief.  XII.  The  world  shall  mourn  her  loss,  And  all  her  lovers  Shall  die  of  grief.  XIII.  The  world  shall  mourn  her  loss,  And  all  her  lovers  Shall  die  of  grief.  XIV.
