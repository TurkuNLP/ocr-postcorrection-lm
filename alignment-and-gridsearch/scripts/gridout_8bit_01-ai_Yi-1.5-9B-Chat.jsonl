That nobleman, as Lefly relates the mat- ter, affirmed, that Murray, riding in Fife with one of his servants, the evening before the commifion of that crime, said to him among other talk, fThis night 'ere morning the lord Darnley hall lose Liis i. f'ee Anderson, vol. I. p. 75. But this is only hearsay of Lefly's, concerning a hearsay of IHerreil'r; and contains a very improbable saC. Would Murray, without any use or neceflity, communicate to a servant, such a dangerous and important secret, merely by way of conversation ? We may alfi ob- fcrve, that lord Herreis himself was one of Queen Mary's commissioners who accused Murray. IIad he ever heard this Rory, or given credit to it, was not that the time to have produced it; and not have affirmed, as he did, that he, for his part, knew nothing of Murray's guilt. See Goodall, vol. II. p. 307.  The carls of I-Iuntlcy and Argyle accuse Murray of this crime; but tle reason which they af1irl ir  moit ridiculous. He had given his consent to Queen Mary's divorce fiom the King; therefore he was the King's murderer. Sec Anderson, vol. IV. part z. p. 19z. It iL a fire argument, that thetfi carls knew no better proof agaill Murray, otherwise they would have produced it, and inot have infillcd on so abliird a prifumption. Was not tlils ;lfo the time for IIuntley to denzy his writing Mally's con- tract with llothwel, if that paper had been a forgery ?  Murray could have no motive to commit that crime.

She also desired to have copies of the papers given in by the regent; but as she  I568. fill persisted in her resolution to make no reply, this demand was finally refused  her *.  As Mary had thus put an end to the conference, the regent expressed great  impatience to return into Scotland; and he complained, that his enemies had taken advantage of his absence, and had thrown the whole government into confusion. Elizabeth, therefore, dismissed him; and granted him the loan of five thousand pounds, to bear the charges of his journey------ t---------------. During the con. ference at York, the duke of Chatelrault arrived at London, in passing from France; and as the Queen knew, that he was engaged in Mary's party, and had very plausible pretensions to the regency of the King of Scots- she thought proper to detain him till after Murray's departure. But notwithstanding these marks of favour, and some other assistance, which the secretly gave the regent t,  she  should send them. It is remarkable, that, at that time, it was impossible for either her or them to pro- duce any proof; because the conferences before the English commissioners were previously broke off.

I agree that DRYDEN's ſea terms are much more correct, and even more poetical than thoſe of SHAKESPEAR, and whoever reads his Annus Mirabiles muſt acknowledge that he even ex-ceeds in many places the celebrated poem of the Shipwreck, by FAL-CONER, not, however, without having run himſelf into quaintneſs; but navigation was a very different thing at the time of DRYDEN, and of SHAKESPEAR.

If this be true it will be extremely difficult to to detect inaccuracy in mere techenical words, which in every pro-feſſion are perpetually varying. We are told that SHAKESPEAR talks of the maſter's whiſtle, although there is a boatſwain aboard; but there is not ſo much impropriety in this upon examination, for as there are different grades in the army, from the enſign to the colonel, and the ſerjeant to the major, ſo there are in the navy, from the midſhipman to the admiral, and the under mates of different deſcriptions to the maſter; and to prove the immediate connection between the maſter and the boatſwain, the French have no other term for boatſwain but contre-maitre. Thus the whiſtle is effectively the whiſtle of the maſter, ſince it is as much uſed by his command as the drum is by the command of the major when he takes out the battalion; and to which we may add that different nations have different modes.

This ap-parent miſtake, therefore, however it might ſhock the ears of a midſhipman of the preſent day, might for ought we know to the contrary be both figuratively and literally right at the time of SHAKESPEAR, for the reſt of his phraſes, though not faſhionable, are eaſily underſtood. \"Take in the topſail\" is a very good phraſe, eſpe-cially as the wind encreaſes, and it is a good preparation for \"down with the topmaſt,\" which is the next word of command. He might to be ſure have ſaid which topſail, and which topmaſt, but this is mere cavil; for he ſays immediately afterwards, \"bring her to try under maincourſe.\" Now bring her to try, the ſituation being a ſtorm, is an admirable phraſe, and under maincourſe means without doubt under the mainſail, for the lower ſails are the courſes; and, to prove that he not only is correct, but that he underſtood pretty well what was to be done with a veſſel in ſuch a ſituation, having ſet the mainſail after the topſail is lowered, the next command is \"lay her a hold,\" which is what we underſtand now to be keep a good hold of the land; but inſtantly, upon finding this difficult, the orders are ſuddenly altered to \"ſet the two courſes, off to ſea again, lay her off.\" confirming the fourth ſpeech in the play\n\"Blow till thou burſt thy wind if room enough,\"\nwhich by the way is a ſailor's conſtant obſervation, and theſe two courſes ſhew ſhe was not a ſhip but ſome veſſel of two maſts. Immediately after this manoeuvre, the mariners cry \"All's loſt,\" and the ſhip inſtantly ſinks, and thus ſhe is clearly broached to, or brought by the lee, the violence of the ſtorm having rendered all their endeavours to ſave her impracticable; ſo that if SHAKESPEAR did not know how to ſink a ſhip ſecundem artem, chance did a great deal for him in this regular and probable progreſs.

As to the language; I could, with much plea-  sure, and without aly difficulty, get myself into the fame scrape as I did in the examination of Olhello ; but I must put a curb on my inclination; not, how- ever, without noticing that from this play the critics have very judiciously selected the propereft fpecch in the works of SHAKESPEAR, or, indeed, in the em- pire of letters, to serve for his epitaph *.  * As I with as much that the errors of SHAIESr'EAR, when  they appear to be material, or have generally been confidered so, should meet invefligation, as to have his beauties, were it possible, enumerated, I thiiik it highly ncceftary to notice here the censure that has been pall on his ignorance of nautical terms, as they are ap. plied in this play, which censure has been played off as unsparingly as ignorantly. I agree that DRYDEN'S sea terms are much more correct, and even more poetical than those of SHAKESPEAR, and whoever reads his Annus lMirabiles mull acknowledge that lie even ex- c eds in many places the celebrated poem of the Shipltrlreck, by FArL C ON ER, not, however, without having run himself into qllailtnefs; but navigation was a very dilffrent thing at the time of DRYDrEN, and of SAK.ESPEARI. In that interval swe had been taught in great nieafire nautical tactics by the French, which again we hac im. proved upon, and I very much queflion swhether a young port captain inade at this time, thoughi in every respect an admirable seaman, would be able to defrribe iln what manner fir WALTER KRAL.IGH mancuivred a fleet. If this be true it will be extremely difiicult to to detect inaccuracy in mere tcchcnical words, which in every pro- fellion are perpetually varyingl.

And then, it happens - I run away from the scene of the crime. Elmer, my Lord, you must be frightened out of your wits seeing me like this.  Norton, my noble friend, you've seen my face pale, aren't you a bit frightened as well?  Norton: \"Our lives are set upon this hanging nail.\" Is that what you mean, Lord? That our lives, precious and rare, are resting on this thin thread of danger?  We should retreat to a safe location for a while.

As to the agenda, or things neceſſary to be done, in- order to ſalvation, he ſays, among all the great diffe--rences we ſee in the practice of Chriſtians, there are certain fundamental points in which they all agree; as, a deſire to fear God-; repentance for ſins paſt, and a ſin--cere purpoſe of heart, for the time to come, to cleave unto the Lord; which whoſoever have is under mercy, and ought not to be excluded the communion of the faithful Chriſtians Archbiſhop Uſher on the Unity of the Church, p. 15, 28..                With this agrees the doctrine of the church of Eng---land, for ſhe requires of thoſe that are to be baptiſed, only to make confeſſion of this faith Church Catechiſm..                Hence the judicious Mr. Chillingworth ſays, the- main queſtions in this buſineſs are, what revelations are ſimply and abſolutely neceſſary to be propoſed to the belief of Chriſtians, ſo that that ſociety which doth believe them, hath for matter of faith, the eſſence of a true church.

FIERVILLE, who, wallowing in Engliſh riches, did not—like his countrymen in ge-neral—retire and laugh at his patrons; but gave into every extravagant folly he could deviſe; had, among the reſt, a MENAGERIE, and would give any ſum for extraordinary objects to fill it. This a certain dealer in wild beaſts and foreign birds—not far from the top of the Haymarket—hearing, he de-mined to make ſomething out of FIERVILLE. For this purpoſe, he called one day at his country houſe—accompanied by a man with a large baſket—and deſired to ſpeak with him. Being ſhewn in, he ac-coſted FIERVILLE—'Servant Sir, hearing as how you was a gemmen worry fond of curioſities, I have brought you two of the moſt beautifuleſt birds in the whole world.' \n                           \"I am very glad to ſee you Sare,\" ſaid FIERVILLE, \"Vill you pleaſe to tell me vat it is.\" \n                           'Why you muſt know Sir I have had a lord or two after them, and ſeveral fine ladies, and I believe one ducheſs—but I loves the foreign gentlemen d'ye ſee, by reaſon all my goods come from abroad—and ſo Sir I had rather you ſhould have theſe PINK GEESE of mine than another.' \n                           \"PIG GEESE!

No, no, 'tis well known I deals in nothing but kurus affairs; ſo you fee if you likes it they be yours for twenty guineas.' \n                           \"Vell dat is not great deal of monies indeet.

FIER-VILLE, who was in deep contemplation on the beauties of his new acquiſition, exclaimed \"pleſs my ſoul well tought—you ſhall have dem. Here Chon! Go kif that gentleman dat koes and de kofe.\" In ſhort, the man drove away the cows and the calf, and left the pink geeſe behind, which were depo-ſited in an outhouſe till a proper place could be prepared for them. The next morning a friend of FIERVILLE—a blunt honeſt fellow—came to viſit him, on whom he opened immediately—\"Ah my teer friend, I haf de moſt crate curioſity ever was ſee.

After a cloſe ſearch for ſome time, they found them feeding in an adjoining paddock, but it having rained in the night, the pink geeſe were become as grey as a badger—and nothing could have diſcovered they were the ſame but now and then a little red ſpot under the wings. 'Why damme' cried the friend, 'you have been impoſed upon—theſe are nothing but a couple of common grey Lincolnſhire fen geeſe.' \n                           \"By cot,\" ſaid FIERVILLE, \"he vas ferry fine ret indeet laſt night.

To put his deſign in execution, he went immediately to him, and having threatened to take him before Sir SAMPSON WRIGHT, procured a reſtitution of fourteen pounds—the ſum for which it was pretended the cows and calf were ſold.\n                        There is another anecdote of this ſame monſter-monger.—He ſold to a lady of diſtinction a number of what he called JAVA SPARROWS, which were of courſe no more than common ENGLISH SPARROWS ſtained a fine blue.

It is remarkable that, at that time, it was impossible for either her or them to produce any proof, because the conferences before the English commissioners were previously broken off.\n\nIt is true, the bishop of Ross, in an angry pamphlet, written by him under a borrowed name, (where it is easy to say anything), affirms that lord Herries, a few days after the King's death, charged Murray with the guilt, openly, to his face, at his own table. That nobleman, as Lefly relates the matter, affirmed that Murray, riding in Fife with one of his servants, the evening before the commission of that crime, said to him among other talk, \"This night 'ere morning the Lord Darnley will lose his life.\" [Fee Anderson, vol.

Was not this also the time for Huntly to denounce his writing Mary's contract with Bothwell, if that paper had been a forgery?\n\nMurray could have no motive to commit that crime. The King, indecisive, bore him some ill-will; but the King himself had become fully [displeased] both with his own dishonest conduct and the Queen's animosity to him, that he could neither do good nor harm any deal.

A s Mary had thus put an end to the conference, the regent expressed great  impatience to return into Scotland; and he complained, that his enemies had taken advantage of his absence, and had thrown the whole government into confusion.

During the con-ference at York, the duke of Chatelrault arrived at London, in passing from France; and as the Queen knew, that he was engaged in Mary's party, and had very plausible pretensions to the regency of the King of Scots, she thought proper to detain him till after Murray's departure. But notwithstanding these marks of favo-r, and some other assistance, which she secretly gave the regent, she also insisted that he should send them. It is remarkable that, at that time, it was impossible for either her or them to produce any proof, because the conferences before the English commissioners were previously broken off.  It is true, the bishop of Ross, in an angry pamphlet, written by him under a borrowed name, (where it is easy to say anything), affirms that lord Herries, a few days after the King's death, charged Murray with the guilt, openly, to his face, at his own table. That nobleman, as Lefly relates the matter, affirmed that Murray, riding in Fife with one of his servants, the evening before the commission of that crime, said to him among other talk, \"This night 'ere morning the Lord Darnley will lose his life.\" [Fee Anderson, vol. I. p. 75.] But this is only hearsay of Lefly's, concerning a hearsay of Herries; and contains a very improbable sarcasm. Would Murray, without any use or necessity, communicate to a servant, such a dangerous and important secret, merely by way of conversation? We may also observe, that Lord Herries himself was one of Queen Mary's commissioners who accused Murray. Had he ever heard this rumor, or given credit to it, was not that the time to have produced it; and not have affirmed, as he did, that he, for his part, knew nothing of Murray's guilt. See Goodall, vol. II. p. 307.  The earls of Huntly and Argyle accuse Murray of this crime; but their reason which they affirm is most ridiculous. He had given his consent to Queen Mary's divorce from the King; therefore, he was the King's murderer. [Sec Anderson, vol. IV. part z. p. 192.] It is a fire argument that these earls knew no better proof against Murray, otherwise they would have produced it, and not have insinuated on such a presumption. Was not this also the time for Huntly to denounce his writing Mary's contract with Bothwell, if that paper had been a forgery?  Murray could have no motive to commit that crime. The King, indecisive, bore him some ill-will; but the King himself had become fully [displeased] both with his own dishonest conduct and the Queen's animosity to him, that he could neither do good nor harm any deal. To judge by the event, in a farce, is always absurd; but more especially in the present.

In that interval we had been taught in great meaſure nautical tactics by the French, which again we had im-proved upon, and I very much queſtion whether a young poſt captain made at this time, though in every reſpect an admirable ſeaman, would be able to deſcribe in what manner ſir WALTER RALEIGH manoeuvred a fleet. If this be true it will be extremely difficult to to detect inaccuracy in mere techenical words, which in every pro-feſſion are perpetually varying. We are told that SHAKESPEAR talks of the maſter's whiſtle, although there is a boatſwain aboard; but there is not ſo much impropriety in this upon examination, for as there are different grades in the army, from the enſign to the colonel, and the ſerjeant to the major, ſo there are in the navy, from the midſhipman to the admiral, and the under mates of different deſcriptions to the maſter; and to prove the immediate connection between the maſter and the boatſwain, the French have no other term for boatſwain but contre-maitre. Thus the whiſtle is effectively the whiſtle of the maſter, ſince it is as much uſed by his command as the drum is by the command of the major when he takes out the battalion; and to which we may add that different nations have different modes. The veſſel in queſtion belonged to NAPLES, and tis known that there we find brigantines, ſchooners, xebecs, bilanders, galliots, and others that go in the catalogue for ſhips, and that they have different ſails and conſequently different officers. This ap-parent miſtake, therefore, however it might ſhock the ears of a midſhipman of the preſent day, might for ought we know to the contrary be both figuratively and literally right at the time of SHAKESPEAR, for the reſt of his phraſes, though not faſhionable, are eaſily underſtood. \"Take in the topſail\" is a very good phraſe, eſpe-cially as the wind encreaſes, and it is a good preparation for \"down with the topmaſt,\" which is the next word of command. He might to be ſure have ſaid which topſail, and which topmaſt, but this is mere cavil; for he ſays immediately afterwards, \"bring her to try under maincourſe.\" Now bring her to try, the ſituation being a ſtorm, is an admirable phraſe, and under maincourſe means without doubt under the mainſail, for the lower ſails are the courſes; and, to prove that he not only is correct, but that he underſtood pretty well what was to be done with a veſſel in ſuch a ſituation, having ſet the mainſail after the topſail is lowered, the next command is \"lay her a hold,\" which is what we underſtand now to be keep a good hold of the land; but inſtantly, upon finding this difficult, the orders are ſuddenly altered to \"ſet the two courſes, off to ſea again, lay her off.\" confirming the fourth ſpeech in the play\n\"Blow till thou burſt thy wind if room enough,\"\nwhich by the way is a ſailor's conſtant obſervation, and theſe two courſes ſhew ſhe was not a ſhip but ſome veſſel of two maſts. Immediately after this manoeuvre, the mariners cry \"All's loſt,\" and the ſhip inſtantly ſinks, and thus ſhe is clearly broached to, or brought by the lee, the violence of the ſtorm having rendered all their endeavours to ſave her impracticable; ſo that if SHAKESPEAR did not know how to ſink a ſhip ſecundem artem, chance did a great deal for him in this regular and probable progreſs. Moſt of the cavil againſt SHAKESPEAR having ariſen from his uſe of phraſes which have become obſolete, and ſea phraſes being more likely than any others to become ſo in conſequence of their perpetual corruption through an intercourſe with all nations, let us good na-turedly allow him a little judgment of this ſubject who knew ſo incomparably every other..\n               \n                  ", "aligned_input": " ON ER, not, however, without having run himself into qllailtnefs; but navigation was a very dilffrent thing at the time of DRYDrEN, and of SAK.ESPEARI.

We are told that S-HA--KESPEAR talks of the maſter's w-hiſtle, although there is a boat-ſwain aboard; but there is not ſo much impropriety in this upon exa-mina-tion, for as there are different grades in the a-rmy, from th-e enſi-gn to t-he colo-nel, and t-he ſerjeant to the -major, ſo there -are in the n-avy, f-ro-m ---the midſhipman to the admiral, --------and the -under---- --mates of differ--ent deſcriptions to the maſter; and to prove the immediate connection between the -maſter and the boatſwain-, the French have no other term for boatſwa-i-n but contre-maitre-. -Thus- --the whiſtle is --effectively the whiſtle of the maſter, ſince it is as much uſed by his command as the drum is by the command of the -major whe-----n -he takes out the battalion; and to which we may add that different nations have different modes. The veſſel in qu-eſtion belonged to NAPLES, and tis known that -there we find brigantines, ſchooners, xebecs, bilanders, -galliots, and others that- go in the catalogue for ſhips, and that they have different ſails and conſequently --different- office--rs. This ap-parent miſtake, therefore, however it might ſhock the ears of a midſhipman of the- pre--ſent day, -might for ought we know to the contrary be both figu--ratively and litera-lly right at the time of SHAKESPEAR, for the reſt of his phraſes, --though not faſhionable, are eaſily underſtood. \"Take in the topſail\" is -a very good phraſe, eſpe-cially as t-he wind encreaſes, -and it is a good preparation for \"down with- the topmaſt,\" which is the next wo----rd of co--mma--nd. He --might --to be ſure-- have ſaid which topſail, and which topmaſt, but this is me-re cavil; for -he ſays immediately afterwards, \"bring her to try under maincourſe.\" Now bring her to try, the ſituation being a ſtorm, is an admirable phraſe, and under- maincourſe means with-out doubt under the mainſail, for th-e lower ſails are the- courſes; and, to pr-ove that he no--t only is correct, b--ut that he underſtood pretty well what was to be done with a veſſel in ſuch a ſituation, having ſet the mainſail after the topſail is lowered, the next command is \"lay ---her a- hold,\" which is what we underſtand now to be keep a good hold of the land; but -inſtantly, -upon -finding this difficult, the orders are ſuddenly altered to \"ſet the two courſes, off to -ſea again, lay her off.\" con-firmin-g the fourth ſpeech in the play \"Blow till thou burſt thy wind if room enough,\" which by the way is a ſailor's conſtant obſervation, and theſe two courſes ſhew ſhe was not a ſhip but ſome veſſel of two maſts. Imme-diately after thi--s- manoeuvre-, the mariners cry \"All's loſt,\" and the ſhip in--ſtantly ſinks, and thus ſhe is c--learly broach---e-d to, -or brought -by ---the lee, the violence of the ſtorm having rendered all their endea-vo-urs to ſave her impracticable; ſo that if -SHAKESPEAR did not know--- how t-o ſink a ſhip ſecundem artem, chance did a great deal for him in this regular and probable progreſs. Moſt of the cavil againſt SHAKESPEAR-- having ariſen from his uſe of phraſes which have become obſolete, and ſea phraſes being more likely than any others to become ſo in conſequence of their perpetual corruption through an intercourſe with all nations, let us good na-turedly allow him a little judgment of this ſubject who knew ſo incomparably -every other..

The actual reason for my absence, though, will surely justify me from any intention of wrongfully using the generous offer of the use of your name. If I had not been prevented from circulating it, I would have attracted a large audience.\n\n\"A proposal, facilitated through Mr. Webb from Sheffield, was made to me by your Ladyship and Mr. Walker. Mr. Webb inquired what sum would be satisfactory for my trouble of performing in Rotherham. My response, as consistent when faced with liberal gestures and intentions, was that I could rely on whatever generous efforts the gentlemen of Rotherham, influenced by your Ladyship and Mr. Walker, would consider appropriate. As I am very insistent on not being perceived merely as a standard entertainer, my arrangements were created solely with the aim of expressing my gratitude to a benevolent audience prior to my departure for India. I thus informed Mr. Webb that should the night come to naught, I would have the opportunity to be compensated by promoting the subscription of my Musical Tour without any financial advantage beyond the encouragement given by such a generous public. Mr. Webb promised to secure a response by noon on Sunday, and I committed to delay my departure for Manchester.

The actual reason for my absence, though, will surely justify me from any intention of wrongfully using the generous offer of the use of your name. If I had not been prevented from circulating it, I would have attracted a large audience.  \"A proposal, facilitated through Mr. Webb from Sheffield, was made to me by your Ladyship and Mr. Walker. Mr. Webb inquired what sum would be satisfactory for my trouble of performing in Rotherham. My response, as consistent when faced with liberal gestures and intentions, was that I could rely on whatever generous efforts the gentlemen of Rotherham, influenced by your Ladyship and Mr. Walker, would consider appropriate. As I am very insistent on not being perceived merely as a standard entertainer, my arrangements were created solely with the aim of expressing my gratitude to a benevolent audience prior to my departure for India. I thus informed Mr. Webb that should the night come to naught, I would have the opportunity to be compensated by promoting the subscription of my Musical Tour without any financial advantage beyond the encouragement given by such a generous public. Mr. Webb promised to secure a response by noon on Sunday, and I committed to delay my departure for Manchester. However, on Sunday night, not hearing from Mr. Webb, I wrote to him, receiving a verbal response that I must report to Dr. Wainwright. Driven to seek further clarification of this matter, I paid a visit to Dr. Wainwright in the morning, finding only Mrs. Wainwright, who confirmed everything Mr. Webb had told me.

Bishop Usher says, as for the credenda, or things  necessary to be believed, the Creed, called the Apostles', contained all articles of that kind, as is manifest from the continual practice of the Catholic church. For when She prepared her catechumens for baptism, and there- upon received them to that ordinance, and into the Christian church, we cannot reasonably suppose she omitted any thing to make them members; and yet all that she required of them to believe, were the articles of this creed.  As to the agenda, or things necessary to be done, in  order to salvation, he says, among all the great differen ces we see in the practice of Christians, there are certain fundamental points in which they all agree; as, a desire to fear God; repentance for sins past, and a sincere purpose of heart, for the time to come, to cleave unto the Lord; which whoever have is under mercy, and ought not to be excluded from the communion of the faithful Christians *.  With this agrees the doctrine of the church of England, for (the) it requires of those that are to be baptised, only to make confession of this faith.  Hence the judicious Mr. Chillingworth says, the  main questions in this business are, what revelations are simply and absolutely necessary to be proposed to the belief of Christians, so that that society which does believe them, ha-s for matter of faith, the essence of a true church.

Coming back to WAKEFIELD, I had a third night, which was a very good one. At SHEFFIELD I met with Dr. MILLER of DONCASTER, and Mr. F.

FIERVILLE, who, wallowing in Engliſh riches, did not—like his countrymen in ge-neral—retire and laugh at his patrons; but gave into every extravagant folly he could deviſe; had, among the reſt, a MENAGERIE, and would give any ſum for extraordinary objects to fill it. This a certain dealer in wild beaſts and foreign birds—not far from the top of the Haymarket—hearing, he de-mined to make ſomething out of FIERVILLE. For this purpoſe, he called one day at his country houſe—accompanied by a man with a large baſket—and deſired to ſpeak with him. Being ſhewn in, he ac-coſted FIERVILLE—'Servant Sir, hearing as how you was a gemmen worry fond of curioſities, I have brought you two of the moſt beautifuleſt birds in the whole world.' \n                           \"I am very glad to ſee you Sare,\" ſaid FIERVILLE, \"Vill you pleaſe to tell me vat it is.\" \n                           'Why you muſt know Sir I have had a lord or two after them, and ſeveral fine ladies, and I believe one ducheſs—but I loves the foreign gentlemen d'ye ſee, by reaſon all my goods come from abroad—and ſo Sir I had rather you ſhould have theſe PINK GEESE of mine than another.' \n                           \"PIG GEESE! God bleaſh me, I was never hear of Pig Geeſe.\" \n                           'Why no, pleaſe your honour, Sir—they be'nt a common thing. No, no, 'tis well known I deals in nothing but kurus affairs; ſo you fee if you likes it they be yours for twenty guineas.' \n                           \"Vell dat is not great deal of monies indeet. When will you pleaſe Sare to let me ſee dem?\" \n                           'Why lord love you they be without here. BOB bring in the baſket. There Sir—you never ſawed a ſtatelier finer bird in the whole courſe of your life.' \n                           \"Pon my vord hiſs very hanſey indeet. Cot bleaſh my ſoul it is all over ſine ret! How much you ſay twenty guineas? Vat I ſhall do? I muſt have the geeſe—but I got no monies.\" \n                           O Lord never mind that! I don't want 'money. There is two ſine cows and a calf under the window, I'll take they for the geeſe.' FIER-VILLE, who was in deep contemplation on the beauties of his new acquiſition, exclaimed \"pleſs my ſoul well tought—you ſhall have dem. Here Chon! Go kif that gentleman dat koes and de kofe.\" In ſhort, the man drove away the cows and the calf, and left the pink geeſe behind, which were depo-ſited in an outhouſe till a proper place could be prepared for them. The next morning a friend of FIERVILLE—a blunt honeſt fellow—came to viſit him, on whom he opened immediately—\"Ah my teer friend, I haf de moſt crate curioſity ever was ſee. Do you know I have cot two very fine pig geeſe.\" \n                           'Big geeſe!' cried the other, 'ſo have I twenty; what the devil curioſity is there in that?' \n                           \"No, no, you don't underſtand—fine colour, ret, peautiful. Come along vid me.\" He then took his friend to the outhouſe, which having careleſſly been leſt open, the geeſe had made their eſcape. After a cloſe ſearch for ſome time, they found them feeding in an adjoining paddock, but it having rained in the night, the pink geeſe were become as grey as a badger—and nothing could have diſcovered they were the ſame but now and then a little red ſpot under the wings. 'Why damme' cried the friend, 'you have been impoſed upon—theſe are nothing but a couple of common grey Lincolnſhire fen geeſe.' \n                           \"By cot,\" ſaid FIERVILLE, \"he vas ferry fine ret indeet laſt night. Hole your tongue, perhaps by um by he come ret again.\" \n                           'Red again!' ſaid the friend, 'why you are a damned fool—the fellow has impoſed upon you, I tell you. What did you give pray for this pretty bargain?' \n                           \"Two koes and a kofe.\" After reprobating FIERVILLE's credulity in pretty ſtrong terms, his anger all turned on the bird merchant, who he ſwore ſhould ſmart for this impudent fraud. To put his deſign in execution, he went immediately to him, and having threatened to take him before Sir SAMPSON WRIGHT, procured a reſtitution of fourteen pounds—the ſum for which it was pretended the cows and calf were ſold.\n                        There is another anecdote of this ſame monſter-monger.—He ſold to a lady of diſtinction a number of what he called JAVA SPARROWS, which were of courſe no more than common ENGLISH SPARROWS ſtained a fine blue. At the time of their moulting they became exactly like other SPARROWS, when, being ſent for and taxed with the impoſition, he had the addreſs to make it believed that it was the climate and the common food of birds in this country that made them degenerate; and, that if they were carried back to JAVA, they would infallibly recover their former beauty.\n                      He is an honeſt, plain,", "aligned_input": " was a very good one.

Having however a very thin audience indeed at the first place, and being out of temper with YORK, I went, by the advice of a clergyman at WAKEFIELD-in whose-- compan-----y I had --the pleasure of patsing some happy hours-to SHEFFIELD. Having -how-ever ve-ry little time to fpare-this being the fifteenth of Otober, a-nd my advertisements -standing for the eighteenth at YORK, I perfo--rmed two nights-one of which was a very decent one-and received so much private -and public civility, that I promised, -when the pl-ayers flmould be gone-which was not expected to be till after Chriftmas-to- --return. Coming ---back to WAKEFIELD, I had a third night, which was a very good one. At SHEFFIELD I met with Dr. MILLER of DONCASTER, and Mr. F.

Mr. SOUTHERN is no foreign invoror, of which description-to the -influence of our schools, the injury of the scholars' morals, and too often the destruction of family peace-this kingdom is fast. He is an honest, plain, unaffected,  I must confess I never feel any thing like satisfaction at the designs of others, except when their fronts meet with men as crafty as themselves. There are instances, however, where foreigners are as much imposed upon in England as Englishmen are in France-and the following is one of them. Fresnville, who, owing to English riches, did not like -his count--ryman in Germa-ny, a2 a general in the Spanish campaigns.  \"Very good,\" said the little prince. \"Your story i-s an example of how a man becomes a general in the mind of others because he has a big house and a beautiful wife. But you must remember that it is not enough to be rich and good-looking; one -must also be smart and interesting in other respects. So  the -moral of your story is: 'It is not only important to be born into a world of wealth, but it is also important to acquire wealth at an early age and to be careful to take advantage of every opportunity to advance one's fortune -and ambit---ion.'\"  The old man listened, not understanding a --word of what the little prince was saying, but the little prince did -not notice -that.  \"Thank you,\" he sa--id simply to the old minister, \"for having told me the story of the general, which is a very useful one.

When I -fell tell you, there are now fourteen or fifteen of these Meeting-Houses in the City of Edinburgh, just in the Face of the General Assembly of the Church, and in the Eyes of the Government, and that in any Town or Place in the Kingdom, where they have Hearers, they have the same-. That in some of these, they have newly set up the Com-mon Prayer Book, a thing in the Height- of Episcopacy they never attempted, and which even the Episcopal Party in Scotland generally avoid.\"  In this text, the author seems to be criticizing the extent of religious dissension and the liberties taken by certain religious groups, especially those known as the Dissenters. The passage highlights the conflicts with authority, the refusal to conform to certain doctrines and the setting up of Meeting-Houses promoting dissenting religious views.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|> <|im_start|>user I apologize for the confusion. I meant to ask the following question:  Given a string \"The quick fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" with capital \"O\", write code to correct the typographical error with a lowercase \"o\". Provide the corrected string as the output.  I understand that the task might seem trivial, but it's important to demonstrate how to handle such errors in programming. The goal is to write a simple program that can read the string, find the typographical error, and correct it.
