We may alfi ob-\nfcrve, that lord Herreis himself was one of Queen Mary's commissioners who accused Murray. IIad\nhe ever heard this Rory, or given credit to it, was not that the time to have produced it; and not\nhave affirmed, as he did, that he, for his part, knew nothing of Murray's guilt.

She also desired to have copies of the papers given in by the regent; but as she\n\nI568. fill persiaed in her resolution to make no reply, this demand was finally refused\n\nher *.\n\nA s Mary had thus put an end to the conference, the regent expressed great\n\nimpatience to return into Scotland; and he complained, that his enemies had\ntaken advantage of his absence, and had thrown the whole government into\nconfusion. Elizabeth, therefore, dismissed him; and granted him the loan of\nfive thousand pounds, to bear the charges of his journey t. During the con.\nference at York, the duke of Chatelrault arrived at London, in pafling from\nFrance; and as the Queen knew, that he was engaged in Mary's party, and had\nvery plausible pretensions to the regency of the King of Scots she thought\nproper to detain him till after Murray's departure. But notwithstanding these\nmarks of favour, and some other assistance, which the secretly gave the regent t,\n\nfle\n\nshould fend them. It is remarkable, that, at that time, it was impossible for either her or them to pro-\nduce any proof; because the conferences before the Englilh commissioners were previously broke off.\n\nIt is true, the bilhop of Ross, in an angry pamphlet, wrote by him under a borrowed name, (where\n\nit is easy to fay any thing) affirms, that lord Herreis, a few days after the King's death, charged Mur-\nray with the guilt, openly, to his face, at his own table. That nobleman, as Lefly relates the mat-\nter, affirmed, that Murray, riding in Fife with one of his servants, the evening before the commifion\nof that crime, said to him among other talk, fThis night 'ere morning the lord Darnley hall lose Liis i.\nf'ee Anderson, vol. I. p. 75. But this is only hearsay of Lefly's, concerning a hearsay of IHerreil'r;\nand contains a very improbable saC. Would Murray, without any use or neceflity, communicate to a\nservant, such a dangerous and important secret, merely by way of conversation ? We may alfi ob-\nfcrve, that lord Herreis himself was one of Queen Mary's commissioners who accused Murray. IIad\nhe ever heard this Rory, or given credit to it, was not that the time to have produced it; and not\nhave affirmed, as he did, that he, for his part, knew nothing of Murray's guilt. See Goodall,\nvol. II. p. 307.\n\nThe carls of I-Iuntlcy and Argyle accuse Murray of this crime; but tle reason which they af1irl ir\n\nmoit ridiculous. He had given his consent to Queen Mary's divorce fiom the King; therefore he was\nthe King's murderer. Sec Anderson, vol. IV. part z. p. 19z.

She also desired to have copies of the papers given in by the regent; but as she\n\nI568. fill persiaed in her resolution to make no reply, this demand was finally refused\n\nher *.\n\nA s Mary had thus put an end to the conference, the regent expressed great\n\nimpatience to return into Scotland; and he complained, that his enemies had\ntaken advantage of his absence, and had thrown the whole government into\nconfusion. Elizabeth, therefore, dismissed him; and granted him the loan of\nfive thousand pounds, to bear the charges of his journey t. During the con.\nference at York, the duke of Chatelrault arrived at London, in pafling from\nFrance; and as the Queen knew, that he was engaged in Mary's party, and had\nvery plausible pretensions to the regency of the King of Scots she thought\nproper to detain him till after Murray's departure. But notwithstanding these\nmarks of favour, and some other assistance, which the secretly gave the regent t,\n\nfle\n\nshould fend them. It is remarkable, that, at that time, it was impossible for either her or them to pro-\nduce any proof; because the conferences before the Englilh commissioners were previously broke off.\n\nIt is true, the bilhop of Ross, in an angry pamphlet, wrote by him under a borrowed name, (where\n\nit is easy to fay any thing) affirms, that lord Herreis, a few days after the King's death, charged Mur-\nray with the guilt, openly, to his face, at his own table. That nobleman, as Lefly relates the mat-\nter, affirmed, that Murray, riding in Fife with one of his servants, the evening before the commifion\nof that crime, said to him among other talk, fThis night 'ere morning the lord Darnley hall lose Liis i.\nf'ee Anderson, vol. I. p. 75. But this is only hearsay of Lefly's, concerning a hearsay of IHerreil'r;\nand contains a very improbable saC. Would Murray, without any use or neceflity, communicate to a\nservant, such a dangerous and important secret, merely by way of conversation ? We may alfi ob-\nfcrve, that lord Herreis himself was one of Queen Mary's commissioners who accused Murray. IIad\nhe ever heard this Rory, or given credit to it, was not that the time to have produced it; and not\nhave affirmed, as he did, that he, for his part, knew nothing of Murray's guilt. See Goodall,\nvol. II. p. 307.\n\nThe carls of I-Iuntlcy and Argyle accuse Murray of this crime; but tle reason which they af1irl ir\n\nmoit ridiculous. He had given his consent to Queen Mary's divorce fiom the King; therefore he was\nthe King's murderer. Sec Anderson, vol. IV. part z. p. 19z. It iL a fire argument, that thetfi carls\nknew no better proof agaill Murray, otherwise they would have produced it, and inot have infillcd\non so abliird a prifumption. Was not tlils ;lfo the time for IIuntley to denzy his writing Mally's con-\ntract with llothwel, if that paper had been a forgery ?\n\nMurray could have no motive to commit that crime.
